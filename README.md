# patient-meds
A React app to search for medicines and patients

## Features
- Search FDA for medicines
- Edit/Delete of Patients
- hover the round button to the right to reveal two additional buttons!
	- Toggle Create Patient
	- "Demo" script adds 250 000 patients

Click around, do stuff. Hopefully most of it works (in Chrome)
Search the patients you need before you add medicines
